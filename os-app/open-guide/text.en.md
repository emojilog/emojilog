# Shortcuts

<div class="OLSKDecorNotice">

*AccessKey* refers to a one or more shortcut keys followed by a single character. Usually it's `Alt` on Windows or `Control+Alt` on macOS, but it changes [based on your browser and operating system](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_accesskey.asp#table2).

*Launcher* refers to the app's command runner: press `Alt+Enter`, type the command, then press `Enter` to run.

# What is remoteStorage?

[remoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io) is an incredible open-source technology for synchronizing data between multiple devices and making it available offline.

It allows the same data to be used in different ways by multiple apps. You could think of it as a USB key for your documents that you can plug into websites to work on your stuff.

You can get one for free from [5apps](https://5apps.com/storage/) or [host your own](https://wiki.remotestorage.io/Servers).
